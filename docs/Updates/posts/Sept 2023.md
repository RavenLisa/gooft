# Release Notes September 2023

As we continue our work on helper documents, we believe our users should be updated with the latest updates for this purpose. From now on, every new update (excluding bug fixes) will be documented here as patch notes.

Now let's dig into the new features of this mega update!

<!-- more -->

* Added comments sections for users to comment right under the guide.
* Entirely revamped dark theme; a new white theme is still in progress.
* Optimized search bar.
* Added updates tab.
* Major bug fixes.

## What's next?

You are the one who will decide that. Your reviews/suggestions help us in making our future plans. Please tell us what you would like for the future of helper documents, how you want to see it!
